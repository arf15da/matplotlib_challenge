You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

My code is located in the pymaceuticals.ipynb in the Pymaceuticals folder, I worked off the starter code then made my changes as needed for my analysis. 

I have done the following on this assignment:

- Prepared the data.

- Generated summary statistics.

- Created bar charts and pie charts.

- Calculated quartiles, find outliers, and created a box plot.

- Created a line plot and a scatter plot.

- Calculated correlation and regression.

- Submited my final analysis.

Please let me know if you have any questions!
